# E-Commerce

## Description
The E-commerce Back Endis an advanced development task aimed at building the server-side functionality for an e-commerce site. This project emphasizes the critical role of e-commerce in the global economy, particularly within the electronics industry, which has seen significant growth in online sales. In response to this trend, the project focuses on equipping developers with the skills needed to construct the back-end infrastructure of an online retail platform, utilizing the latest in web development technologies.

This back-end system is developed using Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, known for its efficiency and scalability in building web and mobile applications. The challenge involves integrating Sequelize, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, which allows developers to write database queries using JavaScript instead of SQL. This approach simplifies database interactions and enhances the application's maintainability and scalability by abstracting complex SQL commands into simple JavaScript methods. The application interacts with a MySQL database, a widely used relational database management system, ensuring that the data storage solution is robust and capable of handling complex data relationships inherent in e-commerce platforms.

Key objectives and functionalities of the project include:

Database Connectivity: Configuring the application to connect to a MySQL database using Sequelize by setting up necessary environment variables for database access.
Database Initialization and Seeding: Implementing commands to create a development database and populate it with test data to simulate a real-world e-commerce environment.
API Functionality: Starting the server to sync Sequelize models to the MySQL database and using Insomnia Core (or similar API testing tools) to demonstrate the API's capabilities. This includes showing how data for categories, products, and tags can be retrieved (GET routes) and manipulated (POST, PUT, DELETE routes) in a structured JSON format.
The project underscores the importance of using ORM for developing e-commerce back ends, as it enables developers to work with databases in a more intuitive and efficient manner. By focusing on the back-end infrastructure, the challenge prepares developers to contribute to the competitive landscape of internet retail, where the ability to quickly adapt and implement advanced technological solutions is key to success.
